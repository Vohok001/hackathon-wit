Not only did our project win the sustainability category, but a recruiter from Google was so impressed with my frontend work that they invited me to interview. Three weeks later, I had my first job as a developer. The supportive environment at HackathonParty gave me the confidence I needed to showcase my skills in a way I never had before.",

I felt completely out of touch with the industry and wasn't sure if there was still a place for me. During the event, I met Sophia who was in a similar situation. We bonded over the challenges of balancing motherhood and a tech career, and decided to create a platform that would help mothers learn coding skills on a flexible schedule. Our hackathon project was just a prototype, but the mentors helped us refine our business model. Today, TechMoms has helped over 3,000 mothers transition into tech roles, and we've raised $2.5M in funding. None of this would have happened if I hadn't gathered the courage to attend HackathonParty that day.",

My advisor suggested attending HackathonParty to get exposure to how ML is applied in business contexts. At the hackathon, I joined a team working on a recommendation system for independent films. My theoretical knowledge combined with my teammates' practical experience resulted in an innovative approach that caught the attention of a Netflix engineering manager who was judging the competition. They encouraged me to apply for their data science team, highlighting how my academic background was actually a strength. Six months later, I was leading a team at Netflix working on similar algorithms. HackathonParty helped me see that my academic experience was valuable in industry settings, I just needed to learn how to translate it.",

          story: "Before HackathonParty, I was used to being the only woman on my engineering teams, which was isolating and often undermined my confidence. At the hackathon, for the first time in my career, I was surrounded by other women engineers with similar experiences. We built a health monitoring application that won the healthcare track, but more importantly, I found a community that understood my challenges. The mentorship I received from senior women in tech inspired me to take more risks in my career. A year later, I joined a healthtech startup as their CTO, and I've made it my mission to build a diverse engineering team. Today, our team is 45% women, and we've created an inclusive culture that attracts top talent from all backgrounds. HackathonParty showed me what was possible when diversity is prioritized.",

          story: "I was working as a QA engineer when I attended HackathonParty on a whim. I joined a team focused on building a secure messaging app, and something clicked. I found cybersecurity fascinating in a way that QA never was for me. After the hackathon, I started taking security courses and eventually transitioned to a security role. But HackathonParty gave me more than a new career direction—it also gave me confidence as a speaker. During the final presentations, despite my nervousness, I received great feedback on how I explained technical concepts. That encouraged me to start speaking at local meetups, which eventually led to conference invitations. Today, I split my time between consulting on cybersecurity and speaking at events to encourage more women to enter the field. What started as a weekend hackathon completely redirected my career path.",
